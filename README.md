# Google Foo Bar

[Google Foo Bar](http://foobar.withgoogle.com) is Google's "secret" recruiting process embedded within their search engine. There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges and difficulty. As the level increases the difficulty increases. I'm currently on Level 3 lets hope for the best. I will be pushing the Solution to the problems as I solve them. (I didn't thought of creatung a repository for this until i reached level 3 so I don't have the exact wording to the questions for Level 1 and 2, Will try to do my best to explain)


Inside each level is a challenge folder with a problem file describing the challenge and constraints, and my solution to the challenge.

### Level 1
- [Encrypt Message](https://github.com/ShadyD45/Google-Foobar/tree/master/)

### Level 2
- [Numbers Station Coded Messages]
- [Gearing Up For Destruction]

### Level 3
- [The Grandest Staircase Of Them All]
