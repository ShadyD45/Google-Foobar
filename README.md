[Google Foo Bar](http://foobar.withgoogle.com) is Google's "secret" recruiting process embedded within their search engine. There are 5 levels, each with a different number of challenges and difficulty. As the level increases the difficulty increases. I'm currently on Level 3 lets hope for the best. I will be pushing the Solution to the problems as I solve them. (I didn't thought of creating a repository for the challenges until I reached level 3 so I don't have the exact wording to some questions, Will try to do my best to explain the questions and solutions)

There will be a solution file in which i will try to explain how i cam up with the solution

To solve the challenge we can only use Java or Python.  
I have used both as per need and simplicity.
